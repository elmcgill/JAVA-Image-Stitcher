# JAVA-Image-Stitcher
COMS 311 Programming Project 2

A JAVA image stitcher made using dynamic programming. 
We used dynamic programming to compute two different shortest path cuts in a matrix, width cut and stitch cut.
We applied these cut methods to an image matrix to reduce the width of an image by x amount.
